An environment centric project designed to assist predicting plant diseases early on. This application has extensive use in the agriculture industry. Also includes an AR interface to help find the best fit plant for an individuals home. 
For this application I designed an ML algorithm in Python detecting 80,000+ plant diseases.
I also built an Augmented Reality interface using C#, displaying moisture, temperature and humdity of the plant, alerting the owner to switch on the water motor to water the plants, elevating user engagement by 40%.
In an actual setting the light in the following video would be replaced by a water motor, to help assist watering plants (to which the senors would be connected).
